# ethical_hacking_notes
I will try my best to organize everything based on what I know (Which isn't much lol) I took a lot of stuff from other people's blogs / githubs. There will be a lot of reading / practicing, once you get all setup and have you computer setup and have the basics down you can try and find bugs and make money on the bug bounty platforms: bugcrowd.com, and hackerone.com
